# unity-vimeditor
Add vim to the Unity's External Tools section in Preferences so all your files open in gvim.

## Verified

I've tested it on multiple platforms:

* On macOS with MacVim installed via brew.
* On Windows with Gvim installed via scoop (vim-nightly).


## Installation

Add this line to your Packages/manifest.json:

    "com.github.idbrii.unity-vimeditor": "https://github.com/idbrii/unity-vimeditor.git#v0.1",
